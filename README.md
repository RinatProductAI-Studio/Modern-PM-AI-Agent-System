Modern PM AI Agent System (Proof of Concept)
This repository demonstrates how a modern, AI‑native Product Manager can design and deliver a multi‑agent system that automates core PM workflows such as risk detection, schedule awareness, planning alignment, and executive reporting.

The goal is not to build a production system.
The goal is to provide a clear, simple, working example of how AI agents can support PM work and how a PM can lead such a project.

This project is part of a portfolio to demonstrate AI‑driven PM capabilities for resumes, LinkedIn, and interviews.

1. Purpose of This Project
This project aims to:

Demonstrate modern PM thinking and AI literacy

Show how AI agents can automate PM workflows

Provide a working proof‑of‑concept Risk Agent

Document a multi‑agent architecture

Serve as a live demo during interviews

Showcase PM leadership in AI transformation

2. What This Project Includes (Alpha Version)
Working Components
Risk Agent (fully implemented in proof‑of‑concept mode)

Detects risks from text

Classifies risks

Scores risks (severity + hybrid probability)

Tracks risks in a simple list

Produces summaries

Proposes actions (requires human approval)

Defined but Not Implemented (Stubs)
Schedule Agent

Planning Agent

Collaboration Agent

Daily Summary Agent

Documentation
Architecture explanation

Agent definitions

Example inputs and outputs

Project structure

Data Storage
risks.json (simple list of risks)

JSON = a simple text format for storing structured data

3. Why This Project Matters
Modern PM roles increasingly require:

Understanding of AI agents

Ability to automate workflows

Ability to design agentic systems

Ability to collaborate with AI tools

Ability to build small prototypes

Ability to explain architecture clearly

This project demonstrates all of these skills in a practical, accessible way.

Risk Agent = the central reasoning engine.
Other agents support it.

5. Risk Agent (Full Implementation)
The Risk Agent includes:

Risk Intake Engine
Listens for signals from text, summaries, or other agents.

Risk Structuring Engine
Creates structured risk entries with:

Title

Description

Category

Impact type

Severity

State

Owner

Probability Engine (Hybrid Model)
Two inputs:

ProbabilityOwner (from questionnaire)

ProbabilitySystem (from schedule analysis)

Final probability = the higher of the two.

State Machine
Risk lifecycle:

Signal detected

Needs validation

Confirmed

Mitigation in progress

Closed

Action Proposal Engine
Suggests actions but never executes without human approval.

7. How to Use This Project
Open the Risk Agent file.

Review how the agent works.

Open the example input file.

Copy the sample text.

Paste it into an AI assistant (Copilot or Claude).

The agent will:

Detect risks

Classify them

Score them

Produce a summary

Copy the output into example_output.md.

Use this project as a demo in interviews.

8. Future Roadmap
Beta
Simulated schedule analysis

Simulated questionnaires

Compound risk detection

PM identity accounts

Demo video

Final
Optional Jira integration

Optional Slack integration

Optional website

Case study

Full multi‑agent orchestration
